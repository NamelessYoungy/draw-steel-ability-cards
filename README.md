## The Cards
The cards are organised by Class, and where they are not from a Class, organised
by category. ie. `Ancestry`, `Combat`, `Complication`, `Kit` and `Perk`.

They are designed to be printed on 2.5" x 3.5" cardstock at 300dpi, but can be
printed on paper and slipped into standard size card sleeves with another card
as backing (I use MTG cards).

I have also added several things characters that can do which are not abilities
to cards (ie. `Detect the Supernatural`). Where I have done this, I have added
the keyword `Nil`.

## Downloading
To download the full set of cards select `<>Code` and `Download Zip`. Individual
files can be downloaded from the directory.
